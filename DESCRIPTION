Description: scider is an user-friendly R package providing functions to model 
    the global density of cells in a slide of spatial transcriptomics data. All functions 
    in the package are built based on the SpatialExperiment object, allowing integration 
    into various spatial transcriptomics-related packages from Bioconductor. After modelling
    density, the package allows for serveral downstream analysis, including co-localization analysis,
    boundary detection analysis and differential density analysis.
