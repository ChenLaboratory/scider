# scider: Spatial cell-type inter-correlation by density in R.

*scider* implements functions to analyse spatial transcriptomics data with cell type annotations by performing cell type correlation via density estimation and cell type co-localization via real number distance. Functions include density estimation, statistical modelling and visualizations.
